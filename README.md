# Atari-Breakout
Atari Breakout is a timeless arcade game where players control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, using it to bounce a ball upwards. The objective? Break through a wall of colorful bricks at the top. Move the paddle left and right with your keyboard or mouse to keep the ball in play. Each time the ball hits a brick, it disappears, earning you points. Be quick and strategic, because missing the ball means losing a life. Click on the screen to respawn ball and press enter to restart. With its simple controls and addictive gameplay, Atari Breakout offers endless hours of brick-breaking fun for players of all ages.
